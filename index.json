To this end, we derive a representation theorem for\nproper losses in supervised learning, which dualizes the Savage representation. We use\nthis theorem to characterize proper weak-label losses and find a condition for them to\nbe lower-bounded. From these theoretical findings, we derive a novel regularization\nscheme called generalized logit squeezing, which makes any proper weak-label loss\nbounded from below, without losing properness. Furthermore, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, as compared to improper or\nunbounded losses. The results highlight the importance of properness and\nlower-boundedness.","tags":[],"title":"Lower-Bounded Proper Losses for Weakly Supervised Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuhei M.

We focus on impurity-boson interactions that are mediated by a closed-channel molecule, as is the case for tuneable interatomic interactions in cold-atom experiments. We show that this two-channel model can be mapped to a boson model with effective boson-boson repulsion, which enables us to solve the three-body ($N=2$) problem analytically and determine the trimer energy for impurity-boson scattering lengths $a\u003e0$. By analyzing the atom-dimer scattering amplitude, we find a critical scattering length $a^∗$ at which the atom-dimer scattering length diverges and the trimer merges into the dimer continuum. We furthermore calculate the tetramer energy exactly for $a\u003e0$ and show that the tetramer also merges with the continuum at $a^∗$. Indeed, since the critical point $a^∗$ formally resembles the unitary point $1/a=0$, we find that all higher-body bound states (involving the impurity and $N\u003e1$ bosons) emerge and disappear at both of these points. We show that the behavior at these “multibody resonances” is universal, since it occurs for any model with an effective three-body repulsion involving the impurity. Thus we see that the fixed-impurity problem is strongly affected by a three-body parameter even in the absence of the Efimov effect.","tags":["heavy impurity","multibody resonance","few-body problem","ultracold atoms"],"title":"Few-body states of bosons interacting with a heavy quantum impurity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhe-Yu Shi$^*$","Shuhei M.

For noninteracting bosons, we show that a dynamical impurity-boson interaction, mediated by a closed-channel dimer, can induce an effective boson-boson repulsion which strongly modifies the bound states consisting of the impurity and $N$ bosons. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of two universal “multibody” resonances, where all multibody bound states involving any $N$ emerge and disappear. The first multibody resonance corresponds to infinite impurity-boson scattering length, $a\\to +\\infty$, while the second corresponds to the critical scattering length $a^∗\u003e0$ beyond which the trimer ($N=2$ bound state) ceases to exist. Crucially, we show that the existence of $a^∗$ ensures that the ground-state energy in the multibody bound-state region, $\\infty\u003ea\u003ea^∗$, is bounded from below, with a bound that is independent of $N$. Thus, even though the impurity can support multibody bound states, they become increasingly fragile beyond the dimer state. This has implications for the nature of the Bose polaron currently being studied in cold-atom experiments.","tags":["heavy impurity","multibody resonance","few-body problem","ultracold atoms"],"title":"Impurity-Induced Multibody Resonances in a Bose Gas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuhei M.

We find that the length scale associated\nwith Efimov trimers (i.e., the three-body parameter) can strongly affect the polaron’s\nbehavior, even at densities where there are no well-defined Efimov states. However, by\ncomparing our results with recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we argue that the\npolaron energy is a universal function of the Efimov three-body parameter for\nsufficiently low boson densities. We further support this conclusion by showing that\nthe energies of the deepest bound Efimov trimers and tetramers at unitarity are\nuniversally related to one another, regardless of the microscopic model. On the other\nhand, we find that the quasiparticle residue and effective mass sensitively depend on\nthe coherence length $\\xi$ of the BEC, with the residue tending to zero as $\\xi$\ndiverges, in a manner akin to the orthogonality catastrophe.","tags":["Bose polarons","impurity problem","few-body problem","Efimov physics","ultracold atoms"],"title":"Universality of an Impurity in a Bose-Einstein Condensate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuhei M.

We prove the adiabatic sweep theorem for a\n$p$-wave resonance which reveals the thermodynamic implication of the $p$-wave\ncontact. In contrast to the unitary Fermi gas in which Tan’s contact is universal, the\n$p$-wave contact depends on the short-range details of the interaction.","tags":["universal relations","p-wave resonance","p-wave contact","ultracold atoms"],"title":"Universal High-Momentum Asymptote and Thermodynamic Relations in a Spinless Fermi Gas with a Resonant $p$-Wave Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuhei M.
